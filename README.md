##About

A series of tutorials are on their way to explain the flow of the game engine. These will explain how the engine works and the ideas behind all the implementations. This should hopefully help developers who want to make games or create extensions for the game engine to be able to do so easily.

##Install

Usually starting to use the Abereth game engine would take quite some time to set up, but we've made an easy launcher that should simplify the whole process, it is suitable for multiple IDE's and different desktop environments. Download it here: (currently in progress)
